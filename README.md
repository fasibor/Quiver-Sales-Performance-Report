## Why This Project is Useful
In today's competitive landscape, understanding historical performance and customer behavior is essential. This project provides insights that:

- Reveal growth in sales, profit, and operational efficiency  
- Highlight key product and customer drivers  
- Guide expansion into underperforming regions  
- Support customer retention and segment diversification

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance (2020â€“2023)
Between 2020 and 2023, total sales reached $6.36 million, reflecting a strong year-over-year (YOY) growth rate of 50%. During the same period, total profit amounted to $1 million, growing at 34.6% YOY. Additionally, the total quantity of items sold across all product categories stood at 271,000 units, also showing a robust 50% YOY growth. These metrics indicate consistent performance and solid upward momentum across sales, profit, and volume.

### Segment-wise Sales Performance
Sales performance by segment reveals that the corporate segment led the market with $4 million in revenue and a YOY growth rate of 50.1%. The consumer segment followed with $2 million in sales, growing at 48.7% YOY. Meanwhile, the self-employed segment, though smaller in size, generated $518,000 in sales and outpaced others in growth with a 55% YOY increase. This highlights especially strong momentum among self-employed customers.

### Product Subcategory Insights
Cosmetic subcategories demonstrated substantial year-over-year growth, with most categories ranging between 45% and 64%. Nail care products, shampoos and conditioners, and eye shadows and pencils were the top performers in terms of overall sales volume. Fragrances recorded the highest growth at 63.9%, signaling rising demand, while lipsticks remained flat with no growth. Trend visuals indicate that the majority of subcategories experienced steady or increasing sales, suggesting strong and sustained customer interest.

### Regional Market Performance
From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific led the market with nearly $2 million in sales, making it the highest-performing region. Europe, USCA, and LATAM each contributed sales exceeding $1 million, all showing healthy year-over-year growth. Although Africa had the lowest sales volume, it still showed improvement compared to the previous year. Overall, the data reflects strong regional performance, with all markets demonstrating positive growth and Asia Pacific emerging as the dominant sales driver.

## Actionable Recommendations

- **Scale High-Performing Segments**  
  Given that the corporate segment generates the largest revenue and the self-employed segment shows the fastest growth (+55% YOY), stakeholders should invest in targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and tailored product bundles for these two segments to maximize returns and strengthen customer retention.

- **Capitalize on Top Subcategories**  
  Subcategories like nail care products, shampoos & conditioners, and eye products are leading in both sales and growth. Increasing product variety, bundling offers, and promotional campaigns in these categories can further boost sales. The fragrance category, with the highest YOY growth (+63.9%), should receive additional focus for product innovation and advertising.

- **Revitalize Flat Categories**  
  Lipsticks, which showed no growth, may need a refreshed product strategy, such as introducing trending shades, limited editions, or influencer-driven campaigns to reignite customer interest and reverse stagnation.

- **Expand Regionally with Focused Strategies**  
  With Asia Pacific as the top-performing market, stakeholders should consider increasing distribution channels, retail partnerships, and localized campaigns there. Additionally, Africa, though small in sales, is showing upward potential and could benefit from market development efforts, including pricing strategies and awareness initiatives.

- **Sustain Overall Growth Through Innovation**  
  Maintaining 50% YOY growth across sales and quantity sold suggests a strong business trajectory. To sustain this, invest in product development, digital sales infrastructure, and customer experience optimization to stay ahead of market demand and competitors.
